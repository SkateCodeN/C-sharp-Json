How to read JSON files with C# and what to do with them 


We have a challenge where we will read an example of a JSON file as follows:

Example of JSON File

{
 "parAmount": 1000.0,
 "yearsUntilMaturity": 10,
 "coupon": 0.05,
 "couponFrequency": 2,
 "couponTiming": "end",
 "yieldCurve": {
 "1": 1.99,
 "2": 1.84,
 "3": 1.80,
 "5": 1.86,
 "7": 1.97,
 "10": 2.08
 }
}

From here we will use C# to make the necessary calculations. But first let us look up some terminology.
