What the hell is a bond?

Think of a bond as a piece of paper that has the words I.O.U written on it, this bond or IOU has the details 
of the lender and borrower and the terms of how payment will be made.

Bonds are used by companies, municipalities, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations.

Bonds are units of corporate or gov debt and can be tradeable.
